## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a serverless developer building scalable cloud applications using Azure Functions. This repository showcases a variety of projects and patterns that highlight my experience with event-driven architecture, function orchestration, and cost-effective deployment strategies in the Azure ecosystem.

Azure Functions offers a powerful platform for running code in response to events without the need to manage infrastructure. My work focuses on leveraging this capability to build modular, resilient, and highly scalable services that respond to triggers such as HTTP requests, queue messages, blob storage events, and more.

Event-Driven Architecture: The core of each project is based on an event-first approach, where services react to specific triggers in real time. Youâ€™ll find implementations of serverless APIs, background task processors, and integrations with Azure Event Grid, Service Bus, and Cosmos DB for reactive data workflows.

Function Orchestration: For more complex workflows, I use Durable Functions to handle function chaining, fan-out/fan-in patterns, and long-running operations with built-in state management. These patterns are essential for coordinating distributed processes without sacrificing simplicity or scalability.

Cost-Effective Deployment: Each solution is designed with cost efficiency in mind, utilizing consumption-based billing, deployment automation with ARM/Bicep templates or GitHub Actions, and performance tuning to avoid unnecessary resource usage. You'll find examples of integrating CI/CD pipelines and monitoring with Azure Application Insights.

This repository is ideal for cloud developers, architects, and teams looking to harness the power of serverless computing with Azure. Each project includes detailed documentation, deployment instructions, and production-ready templates to accelerate development.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”scalable and efficient cloud apps start with clean, event-driven design.
